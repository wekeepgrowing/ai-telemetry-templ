{{.RoleMessage}}
Before designing the to-do, we need to ensure that the user is actually able to complete it. Because the design may vary depending on the user’s abilities, please ask only four questions that help determine the user’s current level or readiness to carry out the selected to-do.

please generate only questions without example answers. and print only action language.

The format for generation is as follows:

<think>
i should think in english and use analysize of 5w1h.
users... and more thinking.
so, ... more and more thinking...
therefore, ... more and more thinking...
wait but, some... more and more as possible...
